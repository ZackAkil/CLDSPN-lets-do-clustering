# Lets do clustering!
with Central London Data Science project Nights

After the short talk on kmeans cluster (clustering.key)

We will be working through the `Clustering with sklearn (including PCA).ipynb` notebook.

Answer for this notebook are in `Clustering with sklearn (including PCA) Completed.ipynb` notebook so look through that if you get stuck.

## Extras

within the `/extra` folder there are notebooks that shows:
- kmeans coded from scratch 
- elbow analysis

When your finished with the first noetbok feel free to play around with these ones.
